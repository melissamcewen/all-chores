> Writing a horror book called “Chores you didn’t know existed and were supposed to be doing all along“

Later turned into a [long list of all chores](https://github.com/melissamcewen/all-chores) I could think of which I thought I'd turn into a website or app or something. 

Well that hasn't happened yet, though I've been thinking a lot about it. And about chores in general. Like many people, I'm spending more time than usual at home these days. Which means little things that normally wouldn't bother me have suddenly started to matter. 

At the beginning of the pandemic I set out to read ALL of [Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House](https://amzn.to/362v0IR)* by Cheryl Mendelson. I can't remember who recommended it, but it was described by them as being a "bible" of housekeeping. It took me a couple of months, reading a bit every night, but I did finish it. All 896 pages. 

I was laid off around that time, so let's just say I had plenty of time for reading. 

I've always been one of those people who is somehow both "messy" and "organized." I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was about 30, which helped put things in perspective. A lot of adults with ADHD develop elaborate coping strategies – the "organized" part. But no matter how many coping strategies I had, I still was the kind of person who leaves a trail of mess everywhere I go. And often...I just don't notice. Until it's time to work and then every little thing that's messy starts to come into focus randomly. Or my boyfriend is like "why is there water on the floor??"

People have suggested I hire someone to help, but it's not the cleaning I have trouble with, it's more the day to day tasks. Having someone scrub the sink once a week isn't going to solve that. Plus it gives me anxiety to think about. 

Speaking of anxiety, the more I read _Home Comforts_, the more my anxiety ramped up. I'm somewhat of a horror fan so the book lived in my Kindle alongside _The Hellbound Heart_ by Clive Barker. As I turned my Kindle on one night, I mused grimly to myself that _Home Comforts_ was way more horrifying than _The Hellbound Heart_.

It's essentially a book filled with death and disease. _Home Comforts_ lists hundreds of ways to die, including but not limited to:
- grease fires
- drowning in the bathtub
- falling out a window
- poisoning due to mislabeled container
- dryer duct fires
- food poisoning

After the fire chapter had a sleepless night thinking about the fact that our bedroom only has one exit. The next day I ordered a fire ladder (3 stories) from Home Depot.
